## Introduction

This API manages the lectures that took place in just one conference day will take place in two sessions, the first from 9 am to 12 pm and the second from 1 pm to 5 pm where happy hour will start.

## Overview

This API was developed in nodejs using the expressjs framework, configured with Sequelize to use SQL databases, was initially used postgres database but it is possible to use any other installing and configuring, Sucrase for use of import and export, Eslint for code linting, prettier for automatic code standardization, EditorConfig for standardization across various editors and IDEs, Nodemon for automatic reload during development, Jest with Sqlite database for tests and other libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See below for instructions on how to operate in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
stable current version of node, npm and yarn
```

### Installing

A step by step that tell you how to get a development env running

First

```
Clone the project
```

Second

```
Execute `yarn` or `npm install` for installing dependences
```

Third

```
Duplicate `.env.example` to create `.env` with your basic configs
```

Finishing

```
Execute `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` for executing api
```
```
Execute `yarn test` or `npm run test` for testing api
```

## Test Example

Input:

```
{
 "data":[
	"Writing Fast Tests Against Enterprise Rails 60min",
	"Overdoing it in Python 45min",
	"Lua for the Masses 30min",
	"Ruby Errors from Mismatched Gem Versions 45min",
	"Ruby on Rails: Why We Should Move On 60min",
	"Common Ruby Errors 45min",
	"Pair Programming vs Noise 45min",
	"Programming in the Boondocks of Seattle 30min",
	"Ruby vs. Clojure for Back-End Development 30min",
	"User Interface CSS in Rails Apps 30min",
	"Communicating Over Distance 60min",
	"Rails Magic 60min",
	"Woah 30min",
	"Sit Down and Write 30min",
	"Accounting-Driven Development 45min",
	"Clojure Ate Scala (on my project) 45min",
	"A World Without HackerNews 30min",
	"Ruby on Rails Legacy App Maintenance 60min",
	"Rails for Python Developers lightning"
 ]
}
```
Output:

```
